#creating-project

With this project I will automize the setup of new projects.

The script is a copy of my script and minor parts as the access token have to be registerd as a variable.
Also the sublime command is custom and is not available by default.

-->Might expand so that the function can possibly take a second argument: an extension, so that it will also create a corresponding file.
